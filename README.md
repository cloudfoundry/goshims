Have you ever wanted to fake out go system libary calls? In most cases
you create an interface and then provide a mock/fake implementation and
a shim that calls the real calls. That's great if you only have to do it
once. What happens when it becomes a pattern and these little utilities
end up duplicated everywhere...that's a problem. This repo is the
solution.
